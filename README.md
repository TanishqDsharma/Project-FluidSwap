# Project-ZSwap

**Description:** This project will focus on building clone of Uniswap V1. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that aims to be an alternative for CEX.



## Constant Product Market Maker

Automated Market Maker is a general term that embraces different decentralized market maker algos. A constant product market maker is a type of AMM commonly used in DEXs such as uniswap. It operates based on mathematical formula to determine the price of assets in a liquidity pool without relying on an order book.


The formula uniswap works on is: xy=k

Where:
- x: is ether reserve
- y: is token reserve 
- k: is a contanst

NOTE: Uniswap requires that k remains same no matter how much of reservers x or y are.
